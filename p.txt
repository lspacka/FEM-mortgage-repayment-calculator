alright, just made some small changes to the html.
I want you to wire up the logic, considering:
1. all the inputs are required, if its attempted to calc
without any of them then display the .input-error and change the border of .input-container to red
2. the result is to be displayed in .results, changing the  content html to:
<!-- if you think there are better names for the classes in this 
piece of code please chnage them -->
<p>Your results</p>
<p>
    Your results are shown below based on the information you provided. 
    To adjust the results, edit the form and click “calculate repayments” again.
</p>
<div class="results-container">
    <div class="monthly-repay">
        <p>Your monthly repayments</p>
        <p>put number here</p>
    </div>
    <div class="total-repay">
        <p>Total you'll repay over the term</p>
        <p>put number here</p>
    </div>
</div>

obv displaying the results where it says "put number here",
